This is the C++ version of my interview question.  The intent is to give the "TicTacToe" class to the candidate, tell them that it's a PR, and have them code review it.  There's a LOT wrong with this code, so hopefully they'll be able to talk intelligently about what needs to change as well as what should change.  If we get far enough into that, I'll have them talk about optimizing it.
