This is the C++ version of my campus screen question.  The coding part of campus screens are 15-20 minutes, so there's very little time to have them work.

The intent is to give the "Node" and "DoublyLinkedList" classes to the candidate, tell them that it's a PR, and have them code review it. (Note the comment in the code.  The DoublyLinkedList class should only contain the constructor and the RemoveNode.  All the code below that is just scaffolding I threw together to make the code run while I was writing it.)

The code is quite wrong (it misses a bunch of edge cases), so hopefully they'll be able to talk intelligently about what needs to change and be able to write those changes.
